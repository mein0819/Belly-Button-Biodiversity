# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview

This project creates an interactive dashboard that explores the bacteria found in human navels. This dashboard enables volunteers to indentify the top 10 bacteria species in their belly button and allows them to see if one of those species will be used by a company, Improbable Beef, to manufacture synthetic beef. The dashboard includes a dropdown menu to select a subject ID and then displays the subjects data. Three charts are updated and displayed : a bar chart showing the top 10 species found, a bubble chart displaying all the bacteria species found, and a guage showing the belly button washing frequency of the subject.
